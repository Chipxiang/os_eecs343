TO RUN THE TESTS:

* Copy the entire provided-basic-tests directory to a lab machine.

* Navigate to the base directory of your xv6 code.

* From that directory, execute the runtests executable, which is in 
  the provided-basic-tests/tests/ directory.
  Run the executable using a command likea this:
  /path/to/provided-basic-tests/tests/runtests-proj3

* The individual tests are available within the ctests/ folder. You 
  can copy the file you want into a user program and run it 
  locally in xv6 as you wish.

* The output from runtests will indicate which tests you have passed 
  and which you failed (if any).  The output will be saved in 
  runtests.log

For more options available while testing, run the executable with 
the '-h' flag.



TO ADD YOUR OWN TESTS:

* Write your test code and save it in the 
  provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3 directory.
  You may want to copy and paste one of the provided tests into a 
  new file and use that as a basis for writing your new test.

* Each test should be written in its own file.

* Open provided-basic-tests/tests/proj3.py and add your test name to 
  the list of test_values.  The test name should be the same as the 
  filename, but without the .c extension.  For example:

  test_values = [
    {'name': 'clone'},     # Provided. See provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3/clone.c
    {'name': 'badclone'},  # Provided. See provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3/badclone.c
    {'name': 'join'},      # Provided. See provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3/join.c
    {'name': 'my_test'},   # Added. Code in provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3/my_test.c
    {'name': 'my_test2'},  # Added. Code in provided-basic-tests/tests/ctests/proj3/my_test2.c
